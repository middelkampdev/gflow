//! Cross-cutting lifecycle of a bflow invocation: resume lookup, action
//! resolution, the reject → stash → write-state → dispatch ordering contract,
//! state clearing, and the three-way stash-pop policy (see decisions.md,
//! State & Crash-Safety). Lives in the library — not `main.rs` — so the
//! crash-safety ordering is enforced by tests (`tests/lifecycle_test.rs`),
//! not by a comment. `main.rs` keeps only adapter construction and preflight.
