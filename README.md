# bflow — Beans GitFlow CLI

A cross-platform CLI tool that implements the Beans customized gitflow workflow. It detects your current git branch, presents context-appropriate options, and handles all the branching, merging, tagging, and PR creation for you.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap Beans-BV/tap
brew install bflow
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)

```powershell
choco install bflow
```

### Pre-built binaries

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Beans-BV/beans-gitflow/releases) page.

### From source

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

### Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) (GitHub CLI, authenticated via `gh auth login`)

## Branch Model

bflow manages two permanent branches and several short-lived branch types:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "init"
    branch develop
    commit id: "dev work"
    branch feature/login
    commit id: "feat: login"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/login
    branch release/2.6.0
    commit id: "tag v2.6.0-rc.1" tag: "v2.6.0-rc.1"
    branch release-fix/2.6.0/payment
    commit id: "fix: payment"
    checkout release/2.6.0
    merge release-fix/2.6.0/payment
    commit id: "tag v2.6.0-rc.2" tag: "v2.6.0-rc.2"
    checkout main
    merge release/2.6.0
    checkout develop
    merge release/2.6.0
    checkout main
    branch hotfix/2.6.2
    commit id: "hotfix branch"
    branch hotfix-fix/2.6.2/crash
    commit id: "fix: crash"
    checkout hotfix/2.6.2
    merge hotfix-fix/2.6.2/crash
    checkout main
    merge hotfix/2.6.2 tag: "v2.6.2"
    checkout develop
    merge hotfix/2.6.2
```

### Branch Types

| Branch | Created from | Merges into | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `main` / `master` | — | — | Production code |
| `develop` | — | — | Integration branch |
| `feature/{name}` | `develop` | `develop` (PR) | New functionality |
| `fix/{name}` | `develop` | `develop` (PR) | Bug fixes |
| `chore/{name}` | `develop` | `develop` (PR) | Maintenance & tooling |
| `docs/{name}` | `develop` | `develop` (PR) | Documentation |
| `refactor/{name}` | `develop` | `develop` (PR) | Code restructuring |
| `release/{major}.{minor}.{patch}` | `develop` | `main` + `develop` | Release preparation |
| `release-fix/{v}/{name}` | `release/{v}` | `release/{v}` (PR) | Fixes during release |
| `hotfix/{major}.{minor}.{patch}` | `main` | `main` + `develop` + open `release/*` | Urgent production fix |
| `hotfix-fix/{v}/{name}` | `hotfix/{v}` | `hotfix/{v}` (PR) | Fixes during hotfix |

## How It Works

Run `bflow` in any git repository. The tool detects your current branch and shows the appropriate menu.

### Uncommitted Changes

When you run `bflow start` with uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, or untracked files), bflow automatically stashes your changes, creates the new branch, and restores them on the new branch. No flags or prompts needed — your work-in-progress follows you.

If restoring changes causes conflicts with the target branch, bflow leaves the conflicts for you to resolve manually (the stash is preserved as a safety net).

Finish commands (`bflow finish`, `bflow bump`, `bflow sync`) still require a clean working tree.

### On `develop`

```
? What would you like to do?
> start feature
  start fix
  start chore
  start docs
  start refactor
  start release
```

### On `main`

```
? What would you like to do?
> start hotfix fix
```

### On a work branch (feature, fix, chore, docs, refactor)

```
? What would you like to do?
> finish {type}
  start feature
  start fix
  start chore
  start docs
  start refactor
```

Selecting finish creates a PR back to the base branch. You can also start a new branch from the current branch or from `develop`.

### On `release/{v}`

```
? What would you like to do?
> finish release
  start release fix
  bump version
  sync with develop
```

### On `release-fix/{v}/{name}`

```
? What would you like to do?
> finish release fix
```

### On `hotfix/{v}`

```
? What would you like to do?
> finish hotfix
```

### On `hotfix-fix/{v}/{name}`

```
? What would you like to do?
> finish hotfix fix
```

## Non-Interactive CLI (for AI tools & scripts)

All commands can be invoked directly via subcommands, bypassing the interactive menu:

### Start commands

```bash
bflow start feature --name <name> [--base <branch>] [--no-checkout]
bflow start fix --name <name> [--base <branch>] [--no-checkout]
bflow start chore --name <name> [--base <branch>] [--no-checkout]
bflow start docs --name <name> [--base <branch>] [--no-checkout]
bflow start refactor --name <name> [--base <branch>] [--no-checkout]
bflow start release [--major | --minor]
bflow start release-fix --name <name> [--no-checkout]    # must be on a release branch
bflow start hotfix-fix --name <name> [--no-checkout]     # must be on main or hotfix branch
```

`--base` defaults to `develop` when omitted.

`--major` / `--minor` on `start release` skips the interactive prompt and forces the bump level. Useful for scripts and AI agents.

`--no-checkout` creates and pushes the branch without switching to it. You stay on your current branch. Designed for [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) workflows. Not available for `start release`.

### Finish

```bash
bflow finish [--breaking | --breaking=false]
bflow finish --abort   # discard an in-progress release/hotfix finish
```

Infers the action from the current branch type (e.g., creates PR on work branches, merges + tags on release/hotfix branches).

On feature, fix, and refactor branches, `bflow finish` asks whether the work contains breaking changes. Pass `--breaking` (true) or `--breaking=false` to skip the prompt in non-interactive contexts. The flag is honored on any work branch type.

#### Resuming after a merge conflict

`bflow finish` on **release** and **hotfix** branches is **idempotent**: if a merge into `main`, `develop`, or an open `release/*` branch conflicts, resolve the conflict in your editor, `git commit` the merge, then re-run `bflow finish`. Steps that already completed (merges, tags, pushes, branch deletion) are detected from git state and skipped — the flow continues from the first incomplete step.

State is tracked in `.git/bflow-finish.state` so re-runs work even after HEAD has moved off the source branch during conflict resolution. Use `bflow finish --abort` to discard the in-progress state and start fresh.

#### PR templates

When `bflow finish` opens a PR, it picks the body template by branch type. Place templates in `.github/pr-templates/` named `bflow-<key>.md`. Resolution is most-specific first:

1. **Branch-specific** — `bflow-<type>.md` (e.g. `bflow-release-fix.md`)
2. **Group** — the fix family (`fix`, `release-fix`, `hotfix-fix`) shares `bflow-fix.md`; every other type's group equals its own name
3. **Default** — `bflow-default.md`
4. **Git default** — the repo's own `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (and the other paths `gh` recognizes), else an empty body

| File | Applies to |
|------|-----------|
| `bflow-feature.md` | `feature/*` |
| `bflow-fix.md` | the fix family — `fix/*`, `release-fix/*`, `hotfix-fix/*` (unless overridden below) |
| `bflow-release-fix.md` | only `release-fix/*` (overrides `bflow-fix.md`) |
| `bflow-hotfix-fix.md` | only `hotfix-fix/*` (overrides `bflow-fix.md`) |
| `bflow-chore.md` / `bflow-docs.md` / `bflow-refactor.md` | `chore/*` / `docs/*` / `refactor/*` |
| `bflow-default.md` | any PR with no more specific match |

The feature is opt-in: with no `.github/pr-templates/` directory, bflow falls back to the existing git default behavior unchanged.

### Release-only commands

```bash
bflow bump    # bump patch version
bflow sync    # sync release into develop
```

Both require being on a release branch.

## Workflows

### Feature / Fix / Chore / Docs / Refactor

Simple workflow for day-to-day work:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as develop
    participant W as feature/login

    D->>W: bflow → start feature → "login"
    Note over W: Do your work, commit, push
    W->>D: bflow → finish feature (creates PR)
```

### Release

Releases are tagged for deployment. Build agents auto-deploy based on tags.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as develop
    participant R as release/2.6.0
    participant RF as release-fix/2.6.0/payment
    participant M as main

    D->>R: bflow → start release (auto-creates release/2.6.0)
    Note over R: Tagged v2.6.0-rc.1
    R->>RF: Creates release-fix/2.6.0/payment
    Note over RF: Fix the issue
    RF->>R: bflow → finish release fix (PR)
    Note over R: bflow → bump version → tags v2.6.0-rc.2
    Note over R: bflow → sync with develop (if needed)
    R->>M: bflow → finish release
    R->>D: merges into develop
    Note over R: Branch deleted
```

#### Release commands

When starting a release, bflow scans commits since the last release for breaking changes and preselects major or minor accordingly. A commit is considered breaking if its title has `!` before the colon (e.g. `feat!: drop legacy API`, `refactor(auth)!: rewrite`), or if the body contains a line starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `BREAKING-CHANGE:` (case-insensitive, per [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).

When finishing a feature, fix, or refactor branch, bflow asks whether the work contains breaking changes. If yes, the PR title gets a `!` suffix (e.g. `feat!: name`) so the signal carries into the commit history and gets picked up at the next release. For non-interactive use (scripts, CI, AI agents), pass `--breaking` (true) or `--breaking=false` to skip the prompt.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **bflow bump** | Creates next RC tag (v2.6.0-rc.1 → v2.6.0-rc.2) |
| **bflow sync** | Merges release changes into `develop` for fixes needed immediately |
| **bflow finish** | Creates clean production tag (v2.6.0), merges into `main` + `develop`, cleans up branch |

> **RC-head guard:** `bflow finish` on a release branch is rejected if HEAD has commits past the latest RC tag. Every commit merged to `main` must have been validated on staging via an RC deploy. If the guard fires, run `bflow bump` to cut the next RC, wait for staging to pass, then `bflow finish`.

### Hotfix

For urgent production fixes:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as main
    participant H as hotfix/2.6.1
    participant HF as hotfix-fix/2.6.1/crash
    participant D as develop

    M->>H: bflow → start hotfix fix (auto-creates hotfix/2.6.1)
    H->>HF: Creates hotfix-fix/2.6.1/crash
    Note over HF: Fix the issue
    HF->>H: bflow → finish hotfix fix (PR)
    H->>M: bflow → finish hotfix
    Note over M: Auto-tagged v2.6.1
    H->>D: merges into develop
    Note over H: Branch deleted
```

#### Hotfix while a release is in flight

When a hotfix is finished and a `release/*` branch is open, bflow also propagates the fix into every open release branch (after `main` and `develop`, before cleanup). Without this, the upcoming release would ship a tree that was never validated on staging in its final form — staging deployed the release without the hotfix, and the release-into-main merge would produce a combined tree at production-tag time that no RC ever covered.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "v2.6.1" tag: "v2.6.1"
    branch develop
    commit id: "dev work"
    branch release/2.7.0
    commit id: "release prep" tag: "v2.7.0-rc.5"
    checkout main
    branch hotfix/2.6.2
    commit id: "fix: prod crash"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix/2.6.2 tag: "v2.6.2"
    checkout develop
    merge hotfix/2.6.2
    checkout release/2.7.0
    merge hotfix/2.6.2
    commit id: "bflow bump" tag: "v2.7.0-rc.6"
```

The hotfix lands on `main` (production-tagged `v2.6.2`), `develop`, *and* `release/2.7.0`. Because the release branch advances past its previous RC tag, `bflow finish` on the release will refuse to run until the operator runs `bflow bump` to cut `v2.7.0-rc.6` — at which point staging redeploys the *combined* code, so the eventual `v2.7.0` production tag is validated end-to-end. This is the same RC-head guard that protects every release path: production never deploys a tree that hasn't been validated on staging.

If the merge into a release branch conflicts, bflow surfaces the error and **keeps the hotfix branch alive** so you can resolve the conflict and retry. The merges into `main` and `develop` (and the production tag) have already completed at that point — the hotfix is shipped to production; only the propagation to the release branch is left to finish. Resolve the conflict, `git commit` the merge, and re-run `bflow finish` — already-done steps are skipped and the propagation resumes.

bflow already prevents the related "two open hotfixes" or "two open releases" cases at start-time: [`start.rs`](src/flows/start.rs) reuses an existing branch instead of creating a second one. The only concurrent state allowed is exactly this one — one release + one hotfix.

## Version Resolution

When starting a release-fix or hotfix-fix, bflow automatically resolves the integration branch:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start release fix] --> B{release/* branch exists?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Use existing branch]
    B -- No --> D[Find latest semver tag]
    D --> E[Bump minor version]
    E --> F[Create release/X.Y.0 from develop]
    F --> G[Tag X.Y.0-rc.1]
    G --> H[Create release-fix branch]
    C --> H

    I[Start hotfix fix] --> J{hotfix/* branch exists?}
    J -- Yes --> K[Use existing branch]
    J -- No --> L[Find latest semver tag]
    L --> M[Bump patch version]
    M --> N[Create hotfix/X.Y.Z from main]
    N --> O[Create hotfix-fix branch]
    K --> O
```

## Commit Convention

All commits and PR titles generated by bflow follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Branch type | PR title format |
|------------|----------------|
| `feature/{name}` | `feat: {name}` |
| `fix/{name}` | `fix: {name}` |
| `chore/{name}` | `chore: {name}` |
| `docs/{name}` | `docs: {name}` |
| `refactor/{name}` | `refactor: {name}` |
| `release-fix/{v}/{name}` | `fix: {name}` (dashes → spaces) |
| `hotfix-fix/{v}/{name}` | `fix: {name}` (dashes → spaces) |

For `release-fix` and `hotfix-fix`, dashes in the branch name are converted to spaces in the PR title (e.g. `hotfix-fix/2.1.0/null-crash` → `fix: null crash`), keeping the squash-merged history readable.

Merge commits and tags also follow the convention:
- `chore: create release branch 2.6.0`
- `chore: bump version to v2.6.0-rc.2`
- `chore: release 2.6.0` (tag message for finish release)
- `chore: merge release 2.6.0 into main`
- `chore: merge release 2.6.0 into develop`
- `chore: sync release 2.6.0 with develop`
- `chore: merge hotfix 2.5.4 into main`
- `chore: hotfix 2.5.4` (tag message)
- `chore: merge hotfix 2.5.4 into develop`
- `chore: merge hotfix 2.5.4 into release/2.6.0` (when a release branch is open)

## CI Integration

bflow uses **SemVer pre-release tags** to let CI systems distinguish staging from production deployments:

- **RC tags** (`v1.2.0-rc.1`, `v1.2.0-rc.2`) → staging/test deployments
- **Clean tags** (`v1.2.0`) → production deployments

This follows the convention used by Kubernetes, React, Node.js, Docker, and .NET.

### Tag Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as develop
    participant R as release/2.6.0
    participant M as main
    participant CI as GitHub Actions

    D->>R: bflow start release
    Note over R: Tagged v2.6.0-rc.1
    R-->>CI: v*-rc.* → deploy staging

    Note over R: Fix found, bump
    Note over R: Tagged v2.6.0-rc.2
    R-->>CI: v*-rc.* → deploy staging

    R->>M: bflow finish release
    Note over M: Tagged v2.6.0
    M-->>CI: v* (no dash) → deploy production
```

### GitHub Actions Setup

#### Staging (RC tags)

```yaml
name: Deploy Staging
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*-rc.*']
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Deploying ${{ github.ref_name }} to staging"
```

#### Production (clean tags)

```yaml
name: Deploy Production
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
jobs:
  deploy:
    if: "!contains(github.ref_name, '-')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Deploying ${{ github.ref_name }} to production"
```

> **Why the `if` condition?** GitHub Actions tag patterns cannot exclude — `v*` matches both `v1.2.0` and `v1.2.0-rc.1`. The `if: "!contains(github.ref_name, '-')"` condition skips the job when the tag contains a hyphen (all RC tags do). The staging workflow doesn't need this because `v*-rc.*` only matches RC tags.

### Mobile Apps (Flutter, React Native)

Apple's App Store rejects version strings with hyphens — `CFBundleShortVersionString` only accepts `X.Y.Z` format. The RC tag is a **CI signal**, not the app version.

Your CI pipeline extracts the clean version from the tag and sets the build number separately:

```yaml
name: Deploy Staging
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*-rc.*']
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Extract version from tag
        run: |
          # Tag: "v1.2.0-rc.2" → version: "1.2.0"
          VERSION=$(echo "${{ github.ref_name }}" | sed 's/^v//' | sed 's/-.*//')
          echo "VERSION=$VERSION" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Build & deploy to TestFlight
        run: |
          flutter build ios \
            --build-name=$VERSION \
            --build-number=${{ github.run_number }}
          # TestFlight shows: "1.2.0 (47)"
```

**Traceability:** When a tester reports "bug on 1.2.0 (47)", check CI run #47 → triggered by tag `v1.2.0-rc.2` → `git show v1.2.0-rc.2` → exact commit.
