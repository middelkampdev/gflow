# bflow finish --base <branch> (headless finish)

Goal: `bflow finish --base <branch>` skips the interactive PR-target menu; auto-pick
when detection finds exactly one candidate; error when `--base` is used on branch
types with a fixed target.

## Plan
- [x] RED: cli_test.rs — `--base` parses into `Action::FinishWorkBranch { base }`; `--base` on release branch errors
- [x] GREEN: plumb `base: Option<String>` through `Commands::Finish` → `resolve_action` → `Action::FinishWorkBranch` → `main.rs` → `finish_work_branch`; error on non-work finish
- [x] RED: finish_work_test.rs — explicit base skips detection; unknown base errors; local-only base accepted; single candidate auto-selected (no menu)
- [x] GREEN: validate `--base` via `remote_branch_exists`/`local_branch_exists`; auto-pick single candidate in `detect_parent_branch`
- [x] `cargo test --all` green (199 tests), `cargo clippy --lib --bins` no new warnings
- [x] Docs: README.md (Finish section), .claude/skills/bflow/SKILL.md, CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Commit, dogfood: `finish --base develop --breaking=false`

## Review
Small, KISS change mirroring the existing `--base` on `start`:
- `src/cli.rs`: new optional `--base` on `finish` (conflicts with `--abort` at clap level);
  guard arm rejects it on fixed-target finishes (release/hotfix/release-fix/hotfix-fix).
- `src/menu.rs`: `Action::FinishWorkBranch` carries `base: Option<String>`; interactive
  menu passes `None`.
- `src/flows/finish_work.rs`: explicit base validated via `remote_branch_exists` /
  `local_branch_exists` (detection skipped entirely); `detect_parent_branch` returns a
  single candidate directly instead of a one-item menu. 0-candidate `develop` default
  and multi-candidate menu unchanged.
- Tests: 9 new (5 cli, 4 flow), all watched failing first (TDD). Single-candidate test
  proves the menu is unreached — `show_select` would error without a TTY.
- Verified: 199 tests green, clippy shows only the 2 pre-existing warnings, real-binary
  help/conflict checks pass, branch finished headlessly with the new flag itself.

## Review fixes (PR #12 feedback)
Addressed Copilot review + multi-agent code-review findings:
- [x] `--base` now validated against origin only — local-only bases fail at
  `gh pr create`, so bflow rejects them up-front (Copilot, all 5 threads).
  Test flipped: `finish_work_branch_with_local_only_base_errors`.
- [x] `--base <current-branch>` rejected early instead of failing later with an
  opaque head==base error from gh.
- [x] Resume-state bypass fixed: `resolve_action_with_state` no longer takes the
  resume shortcut when `--base` is present, so the fixed-target rejection in
  `resolve_action` is reachable again (was silently swallowed during a pending
  release/hotfix resume). Unit tests added in `src/main.rs`.
- [x] DRY: fixed-target branch types were enumerated twice in `cli.rs`; extracted
  `BranchType::has_fixed_finish_target()` (mirrors `is_work_branch`).
- [x] Docs corrected in README.md, SKILL.md, CHANGELOG.md ("locally or on origin"
  → "on origin").
- Verified: 203 tests green (4 new), clippy warning count unchanged vs HEAD (15,
  all pre-existing).
